Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of a machine to analyse the data and make accurate predictions based on the data.We often think 
that AI will replace humans, but this is not the case. AI will not replace humans but will add another dimension to HUMAN THINKING i.e. AI wil
add more value to the our(human) judgement.

What is Augmented Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Intelligence, both terms share the same objective, 
but have different approaches. Augmented intelligence has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do.
For example, “reading” 1000 pages in an hour. In contrast, artificial intelligence has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and
processes.However, it’s important to note that AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.

Artificial intelligence? Well, that is the ability for machines to perform tasks that normally require human
intelligence, such as reasoning, natural communication and problem solving. It basically replaces the
need for a human. So, computers doing the work as humans not really needed. And the artificial
intelligence performs certain tasks and makes decisions, and it's incorporated into so many systems
today.
Now contrast that with augmented intelligence. Now this is where you have machines. And you have
humans both working together. And they're doing so to enhance each other's efforts when completing
tasks.
Augmented intelligence systems augment human abilities, things like screen readers for the blind,
voice-driven navigation, or my in-car collision avoidance system. They're all examples of augmented
intelligence at work. They act on our behalf in the physical world, but in a way that complements our
own capabilities.
