## 📘 Module 4: AI Classifies Images (Computer Vision + NLP)

### What is Image Classification?
Image classification is the process where AI identifies objects in images using **Computer Vision**.

Example:
- Image → Cat
- Image → Apple
- Image → Car

### Role of NLP in Image Classification
While Computer Vision detects objects, **NLP provides language understanding**:
- Converts visual data into text labels
- Generates image descriptions
- Helps AI explain what it sees
