Artificial intelligence machines (researchers call them “AI services”) don’t think. They calculate. They represent some of the newest, 
most sophisticated calculating machines in human history. Some can perform what’s called machine learning as they acquire new data.
Others, using calculations arranged in ways inspired by neurons in the human brain, can even perform deep learning with multiple levels
of calculations.

What Is Machine Learning?

To improve the performance of the machine, you expose it to more data to ensure that the machine is trained on numerous characteristics.
The more data you provide for the algorithm, the better the model gets. By providing more data and adjusting parameters, the machine
minimizes errors by repetitive guess work.


What Is Deep Learning?

Deep learning models eliminate the need for feature extractions. For your work in the product department, you decide to use algorithms
based on deep learning to sort fruit by removing the need to define what each product looks like. Feature extraction is built into the 
process without human input. Once you have provided the deep learning model with pictures, it processes the images through different
layers of neural networks. The layers can then learn an implicit representation of the raw data on their own.

What Is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning model similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data.
This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes is reinforced to develop the best
recommendation for a given problem. The foundation of reinforcement learning is rewarding the “right” behavior and punishing the 
“wrong” behavior.

You might be wondering, what does it mean to "reward" a machine? Good question! Rewarding a machine means that you give your agent positive reinforcement for performing the "right" thing and negative reinforcement for performing the "wrong" things.
